Data-Driven Marketing: Predicting Term Deposit Sign-Ups for Banks

Data Science Institute - Cohort 5 - Team 05 Project Report

As a part of our team project, we have chosen "Bank Marketing" dataset and we are approaching this opportunity as a learning experience and to apply statistical and technical skills learnt throughout different modules. We began the project with Exploratory Data Analysis, which hepled analyzing correlation matrix between different variables. On the technical end, we started with identifying and removing the outliers, one-hotcoding variables and converting day/month to cyclical variable.


1. What are the key variables and attributes in your dataset?

Bank Client Data:

age: Age of the client.
job: Type of job.
marital: Marital status.
education: Level of education.
default: Credit in default (binary: "yes", "no").
balance: Average yearly balance in euros.
housing: Has housing loan (binary: "yes", "no").
loan: Has personal loan (binary: "yes", "no").

Contact Data:

contact: Type of communication contact (e.g., telephone).
day: Last contact day of the month.
month: Last contact month of the year.
duration: Last contact duration in seconds.

Campaign Data:

campaign: Number of contacts performed during the campaign.
poutcome: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "unknown", "success", "failure", "other").

Target Variable:

y: Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (binary: "yes", "no").

2. How can we explore the relationships between different variables?

Use correlation matrices to explore relationships between variables.
Employ scatter plots, pair plots, and bar charts to visualize relationships.
Utilize techniques like Chi-square tests for categorical variables and ANOVA for numeric variables to discern dependency.

3. Are there any patterns or trends in the data that we can identify?

Identify trends by performing time series analysis on day and month.
Cluster analysis can reveal patterns in demographic-based responses.
Analyze the effect of the campaign and poutcome on the target variable.

4. Who is the intended audience?
Marketing Strategists
Data Analysts
Banking professionals

5. What is the question our analysis is trying to answer?
To determine factors influencing customers' decision to subscribe to a term deposit.


6. Are there any specific libraries or frameworks that are well-suited to our project requirements?
Exploration and Preprocessing: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
Documentation: Jupyter Notebooks


Machine Learning Model Guiding Questions

1. What are the specific objectives and success criteria for our machine learning model?
Predict customer subscription to a term deposit with high accuracy and precision.
Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score to measure performance.

2. How can we select the most relevant features for training our machine learning model?
Use techniques like feature importance, correlation matrices, and domain knowledge.

3. Are there any missing values or outliers that need to be addressed through preprocessing?
Handle missing values through imputation or deletion.
Normalize or scale features if needed.
Encode categorical features using one-hot encoding or similar techniques.

4. Which machine learning algorithms are suitable for our problem domain?
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks.

5. What techniques can we use to validate and tune the hyperparameters for our models?
Use cross-validation (k-fold) to ensure model generalizability.
Grid Search or Random Search for hyperparameter tuning.

6. How should we split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets?
Split data into training (70%), validation (15%), and test sets (15%).

7. Are there any ethical implications or biases associated with our machine learning model?
Ensure equitable model performance across different demographic groups to avoid bias.
Regularly evaluate and mitigate any identified biases.

8. How can we document our machine learning pipeline and model architecture for future reference?
Document data preprocessing steps, model architecture, and parameters.
