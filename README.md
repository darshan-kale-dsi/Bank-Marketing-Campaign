### Project Objective

A second iteration of such marketing campaing is going to be performed. Based on data compiled on the first iteration, this project aims to find efficiencies and reducing the duration of the campaing while still ensuring a similar success rate can be reached faster, and thus, cheaper. For that, a ranking system is going to be proposed in order to sort potential clients by likelihood of being interested in the product offered. The implementation of this proposal would imply that reaching the top 20% of the ranked clients will lead to the 90% of the expected outcome of the entire campaign. 

### Business Impact -- to be reviewed at the end of the project with the actual savings. 

Assumming the same costs previously shown, the campaing for a ranked list of potential client can the shorten to a third, so instead of eight weeks, it can reach the same sucess rate in about 3, reducing costs in about 60%
