# Team-05---Bank-Marketing

### Business Context

A marketing campaign based on phone calls was carried out by a portuguese bank. Such campaing is aiming to sell subscriptions to term deposit to clients. An initial iteration of such campaign reached almost 45K clients where about 5K purchased the subscription (~11% success rate) and was carried out over the course of two months, with an estimated cost of $126000. 

Based on such first iteration, a second iteration is going to be performed. Based on compiled data, this project aims to find efficiencies and reducing the lenght of the campaing while still ensuring a similar success rate can be reached faster, and thus, cheaper.
